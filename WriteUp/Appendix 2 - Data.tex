\chapter{Data}

For all the data from the simulations visit \url{https://github.com/KarinaMarks/Entropy-Estimators/blob/master/Data/data_normal.csv} for the normal distribution, \url{https://github.com/KarinaMarks/Entropy-Estimators/blob/master/Data/data_uniform.csv} for the uniform distribution and \url{https://github.com/KarinaMarks/Entropy-Estimators/blob/master/Data/data_expo.csv} for the exponential distribution.

The data included here is the summary data created from the above simulated data, by the code set out in appendix \ref{appendix_code}. Note that for the uniform and exponential tables, there is no data for $k=1$, the reasons for this are set out previously in the appropriate chapters.
